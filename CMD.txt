See history commands: DOSKEY /history 
or F7

1. Find Internal Domain name:
systeminfo | findstr /B /C:"Domain"
also
wmic computersystem get domain
also
echo %userdomain% --> Return the Domain without ".local",only the name itself.


2. NSLOOKUP
Type "nslookup" <enter>
This will give you a ">" prompt.
Type "set type=MX <enter>".
Type the domain name <enter>.

Same syntax in one command: nslookup -type=mx "Domain Name"

Search for SPF record:
nslookup -q=TXT [external domain name]
Example: nslookup -q=TXT meteorit.co.il


3. Set the default printer batch file:
rundll32 printui.dll PrintUIEntry /y /n "printer name"
Example: rundll32 printui.dll PrintUIEntry /y /n "Microsoft XPS Document Writer"

4. How to find out which server is the DC:
echo %LOGONSERVER%
or
nltest /dsgetdc:”Internal domain name” --> from example: nltest /dsgetdc:slavgroup.local
or
wmic.exe computersystem get domainrole --> In this case you'll get an output of a number:
5 - Primary Domain Controller
4 - Backup Domain Controller
3 - Member Server
2 - Standalone Server
1 - Member Workstation
0 - Standalone Workstation

Find out the time server your'e synced with:
w32tm /query /peers

Sync time to Israel server:
In elevated mode in CMD:
w32tm /config /update /manualpeerlist:il.pool.ntp.org

Resync with current servers:
w32tm /resync


5. How to find out whether a computer is physical or virtual:
1. systeminfo
2. In System Manufacturer line: If the computer is physical, it will show the motherboard brand name.If it's a VM it will show "VMware".

Another way to determine weather a computer is a VM or physical:
1. systeminfo | findstr /I model
2. If it's a VM, it will show "VMware Virtual Platform". Else, it will show something similar to this: [01]: Intel64 Family 6 Model 23 Stepping 10 GenuineIntel ~2933 Mhz

6. Copy-paste doesn't work.
echo off | clip

--DISM--

Install Telnet Client:
dism /online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:TelnetClient

How to display a list of Windows editions that an image can be changed/upgrade to:
dism.exe /online /get-targeteditions

How to display the edition of Windows:
dism.exe /online /get-currentedition

How to display information about the international settings and languages:
dism.exe /online /get-intl

Scan image to check for corruption:
dism /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth
OR
dism /online /cleanup-image /checkhealth
In "checkhealth", the command will report weather the image is health, repairable, or non-repairable. If the image is non-repairable, you should discard the image and start again. If the image is repairable, use "/restorehealth" argument to repair the image.
NOTE: according to Microsoft, "/checkhealth", "/scanhealth" and "/restorehealth" can only be used in Windows 8 and later, or Windows Server 2012R2 or later, meanning that in earlier versions of Windows these arguments will not work.
BUT: "/scanhealth" did work for me in windows 7, so give it a try anyway.

--WINSXS--
To reduce winsxs folder, use the next command:
dism.exe /online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup
or
dism /online /Cleanup-Image /SpSuperseded

If "dism.exe" does not recognized, it's probably SBS 2008.
Use the following command:
compcln.exe

Retrieve Disks info:
wmic logicaldisk get Description, drivetype, DeviceID
* Description = Local Fixed Disk or Network Connection (mapped drive), deviceID = Disk letter.
drivetype = retrieve values by number:
0 - Unknown, 1 - No Root directory, 2 - Removable Disk, 3 - Local Disk, 4 - Network Drive, 5 - Compact Disk, 6 - RAM Disk

Retrieve CPU Model:
wmic cpu get name

Retrieve BIOS Version:
wmic bios get smbiosbiosversion

Retrieve Local machine Serial Number:
wmic bios get serialnumber

Retrieve RAM Information
wmic MemoryChip get BankLabel, Capacity, MemoryType, TypeDetail, Speed

Retrieve Remote machine Serial Number:
wmic /node:remotehost bios get serialnumber -->WHERE [remotehost] is the remote machine hostname
Ex: wmic /node:cyprusisr bios get serialnumber

Retrieve Local computer model:
(1)
wmic csproduct get name
(2)
wmic csproduct get name, identifyingnumber


Find weather a computer is a physical or a virtual machine:
systeminfo
Look for "System Manufacturer" line. If the machine is VM - it will show "vmware inc". If the machine is physical it will show to manufacturer model.

Find weather a computer is a physical or a virtual machine (dedicated info):
systeminfo | findstr /I model
If the machine is VM - it will show "VMware VirtualPlatform". If the machine is physical it will show the manufacturer model.

Another way:
systeminfo /s %computername% | findstr /c:"Model:" /c:"Host Name" /c:"OS Name"
In "System Model" field it will show "virtual box" or "vmware" if it's a virtual machine, otherwise it will show the real computer model.

Another way (in powershell):
get-wmiobject win32_computersystem | fl model
That will show only one line - the model. It will show "virtual box" or "vmware" if it's a virtual machine, otherwise it will show the real computer model.

Get NIC list and index number:
wmic nic get name, index

Enable NIC with index number: (eg: 7)
wmic path win32_networkadapter where index=7 call enable

Disable NIC with index number: (eg: 7)
wmic path win32_networkadapter where index=7 call disable



Delete IP address from CMD:
netsh interface ipv4 delete address "[NIC's name" addr=[IP address]
example: netsh interface ipv4 delete address "Local Area Connection" addr=192.168.1.168


determine the domain controllers:
nltest /dclist:contoso ---> Internal domain name
Example: nltest /dclist:meteorit2.local

Retrieve time server:
w32tm /query /peers

Remove Microsoft update:
wusa /uninstall /kb:XXXXXXX /quiet /norestart
*XXX refers to the actual Knowledge Base number.

Change local computer name:
WMIC computersystem where caption=’CURRENT‘ rename NEW
* Replace 'CURRENT' current computer name. Change NEW with the new desired name.

Change remote computer name:
WMIC /node:”CURRENT” computersystem call rename “NEW“
* Replace 'CURRENT' current computer name. Change NEW with the new desired name.

Remove local printer:
rundll32 printui.dll,PrintUIEntry /dl /n "printer-name" /c\computer-name
*Replace "printer-name" with actual printer name. Replace computer-name with actual computer name.

Windows Backup stop/start job:

wbadmin stop job
wbadmin start job
-quiet		Runs the subcommand with no prompts to the user.
Example:
wbadmin stop job -quiet

Find user's SID:
wmic useraccount get name,sid
That would retrieve all the users ever connected to this computer (need to verify this statement).
If you know the username and would like to grab only that one user's SID, type the following command and replate "USER" with acutual username:

wmic useraccount where name="USER" get sid

Vice Versa (replace "sid number" with actual SID written between Apostrophes):
wmic useraccount where sid="sid number" get name

Another way to get SID:
whoami /user

Reduce size of a drive:
powercfg.exe /hibernate off


Check MTU:

ping -f 8.8.8.8 -l [number]

* MTU size for optimum network performance.

68 to 1 500 bytes for static mode
576 to 1 500 bytes for DHCP mode
576 to 1 492 bytes for PPPoE mode
larger frame sizes if supported by the FortiGate model - up to 9216 bytes for NP2, NP4, and NP6-accelerated interfaces

If it's a PPPoE mode, try -l 1492, and lower until you get ping back. The number next to -l that you get ping back is the MTU configured on your network.

Startup folder:
These programs start up for the current logged in user only.
shell:startup

These programs start up for all users. To open this folder:
shell:common startup

Windows Version:
winver
